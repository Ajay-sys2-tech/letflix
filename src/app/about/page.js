            User profile pages show a user's registration date and, optionally, their personal ratings of titles. 
            Since 2015, "badges" can be added showing a count of contributions. These badges range from total 
            contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, and biographies. If a registered 
            user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb page, they can add photos through IMDbPRO.

            The title and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all users, but only registered and logged-in users
            can submit new material and suggest edits to existing entries. Most of the site's data has been provided 
            by these volunteers. Registered users with a proven track record are able to add and make corrections to 
            cast lists, credits, and some other data points. However, the addition and removal of images, and 
            alterations to titles, cast and crew names, character names, and plot summaries are subject to an approval 
            process; this usually takes between 24 and 72 hours.
